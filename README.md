Hi! Basically, this is a repo for all my statistical analysis and DEG done for my FYP project

Summary of the code and contents:

DGE Analysis flowchart: description of the analysis methodology and parameters

DGE w_o biorep.R: Main R file for the DGE analysis. Consists of EdgeR, EnhancedVolcano, pheatmaps, clusterprofiller, and pathview.*

DGE w:o biorep.R: old file with original name I can't seem to get rid off. Now sure how it got a forbidden character in it's name.

Bar graph.R AND StdCurve.R: code for biochemical statistical analysis using ggplot2
